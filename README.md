# CS302 - Data Structures and Algorithms (Spring 2021)
This is a compilation of my completed lab assignments from "Data Structures and Algorithms I" (CS302) at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville, taught by Dr. Jens Gregor. Each project directory has their own README.md file that further explains what the program(s) does.
