# Social Network Graph


## Prompt
Everybody knows about social networks and how they can suggest people for you to connect with. In this lab, 
you will write a simple program for doing that. The point of the exercise is for you to learn how to create 
and manipulate a graph. The assignment is simple, but be forewarned that you may run into an obstacle or two. 
So don't delay, start today.

## Implementation
While all three Friendnet1, Friendnet2, and Friendnet3 accomplish the same thing and produce the same output,
they do so using different implementations of graphs. Friendnet1 utilizes a **dense 2D-vector array**. Friendnet2
utilizes a **sparse 2D-vector array**. Friendnet3 utilizes a **vector-set**. The programs read the text files included
that create the social network friends list. The program will add the friends and then the output can be seen by looking
at what has been added to the files.

### Usage
**Command:** ./Friendnet1|Friendnet2|Friendnet3 [seed #]
